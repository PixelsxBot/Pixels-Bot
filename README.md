# Pixels-Bot
Hello everyone , For more information , contact me in discord.

Currently , there are more than 7 bot that i am working on and each of them foucs on one subject!
For example , one bot do the skilling, one bot do the quest(not task), one bot do the task board(the most popular one),....


You contact me in discord,ill explain in depth how it works and after that , you can use the bot.

The price will change based on User number to keep it at a peace that i can manage the support.
You may find yourself in a situation that i say "i do not accept new user".

Keeping user number low have many good pros:
I can support all usernumber myself(the pixels game is not some AAA game that run without problem , so i will be with you if anything happend and ill update bots base on user suggestion and idea)

I can work on improving the stablity (if any new update of game came online)

No ban since low user base can avoid the chance of pixels game developer noticing my bots.


You need to answer some question and after that you will be able to get the bot.These question will be there to stop anyone thats trying to clone my bot or report it to game developer and ruin the bot state.


Ill be happy to explain in more detail.

Reach out to me and lets talk about it.

(There is no discord server that sell my bot and i am the sole owner and developer of these bots.Do not get scammed and check everything)

(Based on user request , i added watermark so that no one can trick people for my bot.yes , others did that to random user)
